# osx-screensaver-profile
Automatically set your Mac screen saver in base of your network connection

### Description ###

This script allows you to dynamically set different your Mac (OS X) screen savers for different network connections.

This program may be useful on laptops used both at home and work.
For instance, at home you want to use a screen saver showing personal picture, while you may use a more professional screen saver at work.
In another scenario, your home network is not fast enough to support live streaming screen savers (such as [JohnCoates/Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/)), while your work network is (this is the default scenario).
